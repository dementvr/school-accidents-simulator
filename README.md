# School Accidents Simulator 🏫⚠️

**School Accidents Simulator** is an interactive simulation project built with Unity. It is designed to model, visualize, and analyze potential safety hazards and emergency scenarios within a school environment. The project serves as an educational tool to train users on safety protocols and emergency response.

## 📋 Project Overview

This simulator provides a virtual environment where users can navigate school premises and interact with various "accident" scenarios. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical safety knowledge and practical decision-making.

### Key Features:
* **Realistic Environments:** Detailed 3D models of classrooms, laboratories, and hallways.
* **Hazard Identification:** Interactive triggers that simulate common accidents (e.g., trips, spills, electrical faults).
* **Decision-Based Logic:** Users must choose the correct course of action to mitigate risks or provide first aid.
* **Educational Feedback:** Real-time analysis of the user's performance during an emergency.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project follows the standard Unity directory structure:

* **`Assets/`** – The core of the project, containing scripts (C#), 3D models, textures, sounds, and scenes.
* **`ProjectSettings/`** – Global project configurations (Input, Physics, Graphics, Tags, etc.).
* **`Packages/`** – External dependencies and Unity-managed modules.
* **`UserSettings/`** – Local editor preferences.
* **`Logs/`** – Debugging information and system logs.
